make sure to import "tuffy-bay.sql" file before using website locally

TODO: 
1. form input restrictions (javascript) 
	-ex. username length 8-12, cannot leave "item price" blank before adding an item
2. allow the user to add item to cart without logging in (then make them login if they try to buy it)
3. searching algorithm needs to be improved (not just exact keyword searching), tuffy_inventory->search_item() in functions.php
4. storing credit card as text (maybe should change to int)
